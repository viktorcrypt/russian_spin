# 🎲 Monad Russian Spin

**Monad Russian Spin** is a blockchain twist on the classic Russian Roulette game,  
built on the **Monad Testnet** with full **Monad Games ID (MGID)** integration.

You start with **10 points**. Each spin of the revolver is a gamble:  
- If you survive, your score is multiplied ×10.  
- If you die… 💀 your score goes to **0**.  
- You can **Cash Out** at any time to secure your points on-chain in the **MGID Leaderboard**.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔗 Seamless integration with **Monad Games ID** via Privy
- 📝 Scores are submitted **on-chain** to MGID Leaderboard
- 🎮 Minimal UI built with Next.js + Tailwind
- 💀 Just like in real life, there are sometimes **misfires** — even with a bullet in the chamber, you might still survive
